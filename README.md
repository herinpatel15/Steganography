# __Steganography__
Steganography is defined as which involves caching of secret information. This word is derived from twoGreek words- ‘stegos’ meaning ‘to cover’ and ‘grayfia’, meaning ‘writing’, thus translating to ‘covered writing’, or ‘hidden writing’. The sensitive information will also be uprooted from the ordinary train or communication at its discovery. With the help of Steganography, we can hide any digital thing like textbook, image, videotape, etc behind a medium.
